Greedy Algorithm for Max-Cut:
The greedy algorithm iteratively seeks to maximize the cut by flipping nodes to increase the cut value.
At each step, it evaluates each possible node flip and selects the one with the highest score improvement.
Continues until no further improvements can be made.

'''
This strategy stops at a local maximum, which makes it unusable for complete graphs. 
The greedy solution gives us a good local solution that can be improved on for problems like Graph Max Cut.
